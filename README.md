#Pokemon Pursuit. 

Check out the live version of the app here ->

A game in which you catch Pokemon hidden in different virtual worlds.  Think pokemon go, but set in a virtual environment.  
A chance to test my developer skills and combine them with my love of designing new worlds and interactions in playful, child-centric way.

**Design**

I developed a simple game logic, so it could be delivered in a week: set target character for player to find, set target world in which character is hidden, player searches worlds until character is found, character is added to player’s bag, new target character is set and hidden in new world, game continues.  It had to be simple so it could be delivered in a week.  Then I selected characters that would require integration with an API (in this case Pokemon) then set about visualising and designing 4 distinct worlds in which the characters might hide:  Space, Ancient Egypt, Water, Home.  Each an opportunity to bring different design skills to the fore.  Then I pseudo-coded the game logic, planned out the development sprint and started development.

**Plan**

By week’s end I was pleased the basic logic of the game was working.  I’d underestimated the work involved in collecting and dropping the 156 characters from the seed file so if I had my time again I’d definitely account better for this effort in my planning.   And while the game itself is quite naive, I’m pleased I was able to grapple successfully with the technical challenge of working both front and back-end to deliver something that was aesthetically pleasing.  I definitely want to keep developing my skills towards becoming a full-stack developer in a context that makes use of my design and visualisation skills.
